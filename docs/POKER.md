## Pre Game

The pre-game screen for Poker is similar to Blackjack. You can add and reorder players to fit the
table. You must select a "Dealer" player to start the game. If using Blinds, then the SB and BB
positions will be automatically assigned. You can configure the forced bet options in the settings,
alongside the amounts.
